# hello-world

👋 Hi there, my name is Jonas. I am enthusiastic, organized and eager-to-learn. As a communicative team player I like to take on responsibility in order to tackle different challenges.

🔍 I’m interested in web development! This year I succesfully obtained a micro degree in web technology at Karel de Grote Hogeschool in which I was introduced to the world of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js (more information down below).

📘 I’m currently following a course called 'Modern JavaScript from the beginning' (21hrs) via Udemy to further broaden my knowledge of JS fundamentals. Afterwards, I will start with courses concerning Typescript (15hrs) and the JS framework React (49hrs).

Next academic year I am planning to enroll in the micro degree called "Web interfaces", which is basically an advanced JavaScript course in which attention is being paid to working with a JS framework (either Angular or React).

📫 Feel free to reach out via DM or boone.jonas@outlook.be


Best
Jonas
