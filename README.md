# hello-world

👋 Hi there, my name is Jonas. I am enthusiastic, organized and eager-to-learn. As a communicative team player I like to take on responsibility in order to tackle different challenges.

🔍 I recently started a new adventure as front-end developer at Euricom. I mainly work with React as preferred framework but aim to become a fullstack developer within the JavaScript ecosystem.
